        <h1 class="apresentacao">💻 Computer Science Student | Bot Development Enthusiast <br><br>
            Currently in the 5th semester of my Computer Science degree, I have been dedicated to transforming my curiosity and passion for technology into practical projects. My focus is on developing WhatsApp bots, an activity that started as a hobby but has also become a rich opportunity for learning and growth. <br><br>
        
            Experienced in tools such as Termux, Node.js, and Python, I am expanding my knowledge by exploring new programming languages for bot creation. Additionally, I am currently learning Java, TypeScript, Angular, and React, broadening my technical repertoire and preparing myself for even greater challenges in software development. <br> <br>
        
            📚 Always Learning: I see challenges as gateways to new discoveries and believe that technology can serve as a bridge to transform ideas into reality. <br> <br>
        
            If you share this enthusiasm for innovation or are looking to exchange experiences, I would be delighted to connect! <br> <br>
